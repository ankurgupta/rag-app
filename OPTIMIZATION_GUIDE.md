# RAG System Optimization Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Fine-Tuning Your RAG Application

This guide explains how to optimize your RAG system for better results based on your specific documents and use cases.

## ðŸ“Š Key Parameters to Tune

### 1. Document Chunking Settings

**Chunk Size (500-2000 characters)**
- **Smaller chunks (500-800)**: Better for specific fact retrieval, more precise matching
- **Larger chunks (1200-2000)**: Better for complex questions requiring context, preserves relationships
- **Recommended**: Start with 1000, adjust based on your document types

**Chunk Overlap (100-500 characters)**
- **Higher overlap (300-500)**: Ensures important information isn't split across chunks
- **Lower overlap (100-200)**: Reduces redundancy, faster processing
- **Recommended**: 200 for most cases, increase for technical documents

### 2. Retrieval Settings

**Search Method**
- **Semantic**: Pure vector similarity, good for conceptual questions
- **Hybrid**: Combines semantic + keyword matching, better for specific terms
- **Recommendation**: Use Hybrid for technical documents, Semantic for general content

**Number of Documents (2-10)**
- **Fewer docs (2-4)**: More focused, less noise
- **More docs (6-10)**: More comprehensive, may include irrelevant info
- **Recommendation**: Start with 4, increase if answers are incomplete

### 3. Advanced Settings

**Semantic vs Keyword Weight (0.0-1.0)**
- **0.7 (Default)**: Balanced approach
- **0.9-1.0**: Pure semantic, good for conceptual questions
- **0.3-0.6**: More keyword-focused, good for specific term searches

**Similarity Score Threshold (0.0-1.0)**
- **0.0**: Include all results (default)
- **0.3-0.5**: Filter out low-relevance results
- **0.7+**: Only highly relevant results

**AI Response Creativity (0.0-1.0)**
- **0.0-0.2**: Very focused, factual responses
- **0.3-0.5**: Balanced creativity and accuracy
- **0.6+**: More creative but potentially less accurate

## ðŸ”§ Optimization Strategies by Document Type

### Technical Documentation
- **Chunk Size**: 1200-1500 (preserve code blocks and technical context)
- **Overlap**: 300-400 (ensure technical terms aren't split)
- **Search Method**: Hybrid with alpha=0.6 (balance concepts and keywords)
- **Documents**: 4-6 (comprehensive but focused)

### Academic Papers
- **Chunk Size**: 1000-1200 (preserve paragraph structure)
- **Overlap**: 200-300 (maintain argument flow)
- **Search Method**: Semantic with alpha=0.8 (conceptual understanding)
- **Documents**: 5-8 (comprehensive coverage)

### General Text/Articles
- **Chunk Size**: 800-1000 (standard paragraph length)
- **Overlap**: 150-250 (standard overlap)
- **Search Method**: Hybrid with alpha=0.7 (balanced)
- **Documents**: 3-5 (focused responses)

### Legal Documents
- **Chunk Size**: 1500-2000 (preserve legal context)
- **Overlap**: 400-500 (ensure legal terms aren't split)
- **Search Method**: Hybrid with alpha=0.5 (keyword-heavy)
- **Documents**: 6-10 (comprehensive legal coverage)

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Document Preprocessing
- Clean your documents before uploading
- Remove headers/footers that don't add value
- Ensure consistent formatting

### 2. Query Optimization
- Be specific in your questions
- Use relevant keywords from your documents
- Ask follow-up questions for clarification

### 3. Model Selection
- **gemini-2.0-flash-001**: Fastest, good for simple Q&A
- **gemini-2.5-flash**: Balanced speed and capability
- **gemini-2.5-pro**: Most capable, best for complex analysis

### 4. Monitoring and Iteration
- Check similarity scores in the Sources section
- Adjust parameters based on result quality
- Test with different question types

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Irrelevant Results
- **Solution**: Increase similarity threshold, reduce number of documents
- **Adjust**: Chunk size (try smaller), search method (try semantic)

### Issue: Incomplete Answers
- **Solution**: Increase number of documents, increase chunk overlap
- **Adjust**: Chunk size (try larger), search method (try hybrid)

### Issue: Too Much Noise
- **Solution**: Increase similarity threshold, use semantic search
- **Adjust**: Reduce number of documents, increase chunk size

### Issue: Missing Specific Terms
- **Solution**: Use hybrid search with lower alpha (0.4-0.6)
- **Adjust**: Increase keyword weight, reduce chunk size

## ðŸ“ˆ Measuring Success

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Relevance**: Are the retrieved documents actually relevant?
2. **Completeness**: Does the answer cover all aspects of the question?
3. **Accuracy**: Is the information correct and well-cited?
4. **Speed**: How quickly are results returned?

### Testing Strategy
1. Create a test set of questions with known answers
2. Test different parameter combinations
3. Compare results quality and speed
4. Document the best settings for your use case

## ðŸ”„ Iterative Improvement Process

1. **Start with defaults** (chunk_size=1000, overlap=200, hybrid search)
2. **Test with sample questions** from your domain
3. **Identify issues** (irrelevant results, incomplete answers, etc.)
4. **Adjust parameters** based on the optimization guide
5. **Re-test and iterate** until you find the best settings
6. **Document your optimal settings** for future use

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Save your vector store** after finding good settings
- **Use different settings** for different types of questions
- **Monitor the Sources section** to understand what's being retrieved
- **Experiment with different models** for different use cases
- **Keep a log** of successful parameter combinations

Remember: The best settings depend on your specific documents and use cases. Start with the recommendations above and adjust based on your results!
